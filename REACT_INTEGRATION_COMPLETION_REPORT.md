/api/admin/events/{id} - GET    (Show event)
/api/admin/events/{id} - PUT    (Update event)
/api/admin/events/{id} - DELETE (Delete event)
```

### Frontend Routes (React)
```
/app/login           - Public login page
/app/dashboard       - Dashboard with stats
/app/events          - Events listing
/app/events/create   - Create new event
/app/events/{id}     - View event details
/app/events/{id}/edit - Edit event
```
