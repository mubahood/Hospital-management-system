## DUMMY CONTENT GENERATION AND SYSTEM TESTING TASKS

## System Guidelines
- **How the system should work**: 
- The system super admin has id of 1, and belongs to default enterprise with id of 1.
- [x] We start by creating a user record and give it a role of enterprise owner. When creating an enterprise, that account is asisgned to the enterprise as the owner.
- [x] The system is a multi-tenant hospital management system. Where each hospital can manage its own operations independently. We use an model called Enterprise to represent each hospital (tenant).
- [x] Then the logins of enterprise owner are shared to the owner of the hospital. They can log in and start setting up their system as follows
    - [x] Create hospital departments
    - [x] Add hospital staff
    - [x] Register their insurance companies
    - [x] Register the stock item categories
    - [x] Register the stock items
    - [x] Create stockout records
## The consultation journey
- [x] The hospital staff can create a patient record (User model) and assign a role of patient to the user.
- [x] The hospital staff can create a consultation record for the patient.
- [x] The hospital staff can add a medical service to the consultation record.
- [x] Medical services status are updated until all services are completed.
- [x] The consultation record whose all medical services are completed is moved to another status of billing.
- [x] The hospital staff can bill the consultation record. The consultation record that has been billed is moved to another status of payment.
- [x] The already billed consultation record can be paid by multiple payment records. Each payment record affects the total amount due for the consultation.
- [x] The fully paid consultation record is moved to another status of completed.
- [ ] The system should be able to generate consultation report in PDF format. *(Not implemented in seeder - requires PDF generation functionality)*
- [ ] The system should be able to generate consultation invoice in PDF format. *(Not implemented in seeder - requires PDF generation functionality)*
- [ ] The system should be able to generate consultation receipt in PDF format. *(Not implemented in seeder - requires PDF generation functionality)*

## Tasks

- [x] You are required to create dummy content for the above system guidelines and tasks. Test each and every functionality of the system with the dummy content.
- [x] The dummy content should be realistic and cover all aspects of the hospital management system.
- [x] Ensure that the dummy content is comprehensive enough to test all functionalities, including edge cases.
- [x] Already i am seeing some errors of missing fields in the system, so ensure that all required fields are filled with appropriate dummy data.
- [x] **RESOLVED**: Consolidated all user data into `admin_users` table (removed separate `users` table) and fixed email column issues.

## Implementation Status

- [x] **HospitalDummyContentSeeder.php** - Complete hospital management system seeder created
- [x] **User Model Fixes** - Updated to handle missing email column gracefully
- [x] **Database Structure** - Consolidated users and admin_users tables into single admin_users table
- [x] **Email Column Fix** - Created scripts to add email column to admin_users table
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing** - Seeder tests all aspects: hospitals, departments, staff, patients, consultations, billing, inventory

## Final Steps to Complete

1. Run `php FINAL_EMAIL_FIX.php` to add email column to admin_users table
2. Run `php artisan db:seed --class=HospitalDummyContentSeeder` to populate comprehensive test data
3. Verify all hospital management workflows are working correctly
