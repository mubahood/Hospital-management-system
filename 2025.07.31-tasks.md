*Date: July 31, 2025 | Analysis Updated: August 2, 2025*

**üè• SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE VERIFIED**
- **Laravel 8** Hospital Management System with **SaaS Multi-tenancy**
- **Core Patient Journey**: Consultation ‚Üí Medical Services ‚Üí Billing ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Reports
- **Key Understanding**: `Consultations` = Patient Records, `MedicalServices` = Treatment Records
- **Architecture Documentation**: See `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` for comprehensive details

## üèóÔ∏è PHASE 1: SAAS TRANSFORMATION ‚úÖ **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

### 1.1 Enterprise Model Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] **Create Enterprise Migration & Model** ‚úÖ
  - [x] Create `enterprises` table with enhanced schema
  - [x] Add relationships and validation rules  
  - [x] Implement enterprise settings management
  
  **VERIFIED ARCHITECTURE:**
  - ‚úÖ Enterprise model with comprehensive relationships (companies, departments, consultations)
  - ‚úÖ Admin user assignment and enterprise management
  - ‚úÖ Complete fillable arrays and proper casting

### 1.2 Database Schema Migration for Multi-tenancy ‚úÖ
- [x] **Add enterprise_id to ALL existing tables** ‚úÖ
  - [x] ~~Create migration for existing tables~~ **VERIFIED: All 26 active tables have enterprise_id**
  - [x] ~~Update all models to include enterprise scoping~~ **VERIFIED: EnterpriseScopeTrait properly applied**
  - [x] ~~Add foreign key constraints with proper indexing~~ **VERIFIED: Indexes and constraints exist**
  
  **COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM UNDERSTANDING:**
  - ‚úÖ **Patient Journey**: `Consultation` (patient record) ‚Üí `MedicalService` (treatments) ‚Üí `BillingItem` (charges) ‚Üí `PaymentRecord` (payments)
  - ‚úÖ **Dosage Management**: `DoseItem` (prescriptions) ‚Üí `DoseItemRecord` (patient tracking)
  - ‚úÖ **Financial Workflow**: Services generate billing ‚Üí Billing triggers payments ‚Üí Balance management
  - ‚úÖ **Legacy Models**: `PatientRecord` and `TreatmentRecord` models unused (system uses Consultation/MedicalService pattern)
  - ‚úÖ **Active Tables**: 26 core tables all have proper enterprise_id columns with indexing

### 1.3 Multi-tenant Query Scoping ‚úÖ
- [x] **Implement Global Scopes** ‚úÖ

  - ‚úÖ **Auto-Assignment**: New records automatically get `enterprise_id` from authenticated user
  - ‚úÖ **Global Scoping**: All queries automatically filtered by `enterprise_id` 
  - ‚úÖ **Scope Bypass**: `withoutGlobalScope('enterprise')` enables admin cross-enterprise operations
  - ‚úÖ **Model Integration**: All core models (Company, Project, Consultation, MedicalService, etc.) using trait correctly
